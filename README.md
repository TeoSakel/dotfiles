# My dotfiles

## To install everything

* Just run `./install` and hope for the best!
* You may want to look into `instal.conf.yaml` before you do so...
* See [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for details about configuration.
* Even then individual files may have some lazy workarounds that fail
* __You have been warned!__

## To install individual packages

* run `./install-standalone` and a directory from `meta`
* __OR__ make a profile in `meta/profiles` and run `./install-profile <profile-file>`

## Requirements

Minimally:

* `git` (dah..)
* the programs that you want to configure (double dah...)
* `bash`
* `curl`
